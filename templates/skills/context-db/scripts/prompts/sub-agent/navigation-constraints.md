# Sub Agent Navigation Constraints

You have two tools. Use ONLY these two tools, nothing else:

1. Bash -- run the TOC script ONLY. No other commands: python3 {toc}
   {context_db_rel}/ python3 {toc} {context_db_rel}/<subfolder>/

2. Read -- read a file by its relative path:
   {context_db_rel}/<subfolder>/file.md

Do NOT use Bash for anything other than the TOC script above. Do NOT run git,
find, grep, ls, pwd, cat, head, curl, npm, or any other command. Do NOT pipe TOC
output through other commands. Do NOT construct absolute paths.

Read descriptions from the TOC output. Drill into what's relevant, skip the
rest.
