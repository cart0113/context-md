# Context Db Memory System

Context-db is the project's memory system. Do not use auto-memory, MEMORY.md, or
any vendor-specific persistence. Users will call the /context-db update skill
when they want to persist important project knowledge. If you think you should
save something to memory, ask the user if they want to run /context-db update
instead.
