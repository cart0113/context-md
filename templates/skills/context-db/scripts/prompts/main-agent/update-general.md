# Update Instructions

Think about your current session — corrections the user made, conventions you
learned, pitfalls you hit, decisions and why. Then decide: would the next agent
get something wrong or miss something without this knowledge? If not, tell the
user there's nothing to add.

Most sessions produce nothing worth storing — that is the normal outcome, not a
failure. Every addition dilutes what's already there, so non-critical entries
actively reduce the system's value.

If there is something worth persisting, use the read mechanics above to see
what's already documented. Update existing files when they cover the topic.
Create new files only for genuinely new topics. You can use other tools — like
running git diff — to provide additional context on what to store.

Project-specific knowledge — decisions, conventions, architecture — typically
belongs in the project's `<name>-project/` folder. Other top-level folders hold
broader standards shared across projects. Route accordingly, but use judgement.

Do not persist things derivable from the code — CLI flags, function signatures,
file layouts. The code is the source of truth for those.

If what you are persisting is critical enough that the next agent must see it
every session (or on every subcommand), emit a single concise hint line after
your update — e.g.
`hint: consider adding <file> to on_startup in .context-db.json`. Only suggest
this when the content is clearly load-bearing; real estate in those files
(especially on_all) is at a premium.

If you are unsure or want clarification, ask the user.

Do not run /context-db update yourself. The user invokes this. If you need to
write to context-db later, use the read mechanics and write-file-format above
directly.
