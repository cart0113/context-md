  Share context-db folders across projects — committed for the team, symlinked

# Cross-Project Sharing

A context-db often contains knowledge useful to multiple projects — coding
standards, domain context, shared conventions. You can share context-db folders
across projects at three levels of visibility, and mix them freely.

## How It Works

Every approach ends the same way: a folder appears inside your `context-db/`
directory, and the TOC script picks it up automatically. The difference is how
that folder gets there and who else sees it.

Because the TOC script generates the TOC on the fly, there are no static files
to get out of sync. If you symlink in a private folder and `.gitignore` it, your
agent sees it in the TOC but nothing changes in git. Other users' agents see
only their own folders.

## Committed Folders (Whole Team)

The simplest case: put the folder directly in `context-db/` and commit it. Every
clone gets it. This is the default for project-specific knowledge.

```
your-project/
  context-db/
    your-project/        # committed — everyone sees this
      architecture.md
      data-model/
```

## Symlink + .gitignore (Just You)

Symlink a folder from another local project and `.gitignore` the symlink. Only
your agent sees it.

```bash
cd context-db
ln -s ~/workspace/OTHER_PROJECT/context-db/coding-standards coding-standards
```

```gitignore
# .gitignore
context-db/coding-standards
```

Your agent runs the TOC script on `context-db/` and sees `coding-standards/` in
the TOC. A teammate's agent does the same and doesn't — because the symlink
isn't there for them. No broken references, no dirty working tree.

**Best for:** Personal reference context. Quick access to another project's
knowledge without any setup for the team.

## Git Submodule (Team, Pinned)

Add the external repo as a git submodule. Every clone gets it.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/org/standards.git external/standards
cd context-db
ln -s ../external/standards/context-db/coding-standards coding-standards
```

Both the submodule and the symlink are committed. The content is pinned to a
specific commit and updated explicitly with `git submodule update --remote`.

**Best for:** Shared external context the whole team should see, when you want
git-native tooling and explicit version pinning.

## Git-Sync (Flexible, Sparse, Private or Shared)

[git-sync](https://github.com/cart0113/GIT_GIT_SYNC) manages external repo
dependencies via YAML config. It supports sparse checkout (pull only the
`context-db/` subfolder), read-only mode, and separate private config.

**Shared config** (`.git-sync.yaml`, committed — whole team):

```yaml
standards:
  path: external/standards
  git-repo: https://github.com/org/standards.git
  read-only: true
  sparse-paths:
    - context-db/coding-standards/
```

**Private config** (`.git-sync-private.yaml`, gitignored — just you):

```yaml
my-notes:
  path: external/my-notes
  git-repo: https://github.com/me/my-notes.git
  read-only: true
  sparse-paths:
    - context-db/
```

Then symlink into `context-db/` and `.gitignore` private paths:

```bash
cd context-db
ln -s ../external/standards/context-db/coding-standards coding-standards
ln -s ../external/my-notes/context-db/research research
```

Git-sync hooks auto-pull on `git pull`, so external context stays current.

**Best for:** Projects that need a mix of shared and private external context,
or where you only want a subset of the external repo.

## Comparison

|                      | Committed  | Symlink + .gitignore | Submodule              | Git-Sync                      |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Who sees it**      | Everyone   | Only you             | Everyone               | Configurable                  |
| **In git**           | Yes        | No                   | Yes                    | Shared config yes, private no |
| **Sparse checkout**  | N/A        | N/A                  | Manual                 | Built-in                      |
| **Extra tooling**    | None       | None                 | None                   | git-sync                      |
| **Update mechanism** | `git pull` | Manual               | `git submodule update` | `git-sync sync` / hooks       |

These approaches compose freely — committed + submodule + private symlinks in
the same `context-db/`. The TOC script shows all of them.
