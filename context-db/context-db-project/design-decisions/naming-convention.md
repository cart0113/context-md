  Why files are named after their parent folder rather than using fixed names

# Naming Convention

Each folder's description file is named `<folder>.md` (or
`<folder>-instructions.md`) rather than a fixed name like `CONTEXT.md`.

## Rationale

- **Self-describing.** `CODING.md` tells you exactly what it describes.
  `CONTEXT.md` in a `CODING/` directory does not.
- **No collision.** If you have `context-db/coding/` and `context-db/database/`,
  the description files are `coding.md` and `database.md`. All unique names,
  easy to search for.
- **Generalizes beyond context-db/.** The convention works for any directory. A
  `docs/api/` directory uses `api.md`.
- **Script simplicity.** The TOC script computes the folder basename and knows
  exactly which description file to look for. No special-casing.
